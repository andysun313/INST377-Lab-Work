Project Information Problem:
My project is trying to solve finding the local community centers in PG county and surrounding area, and finding the phone numbers of those locations simultaenously for easy contact for multiple site locations at a time. 
Finding community/recreation centers is an information problem that is starting to appear again, as COVID restrictions have been recently laid back, and people are starting to come together in the community to do physical activity, hold events, and play sports. The best way to contact these community centers now that they are open again is to find out their locations and call them for availbility and closing hours. 
For this project, I am presenting randomly generated local community centers in the area. I am also displaying the phone numbers for each location, which can be filtered with the search bar based on the results.
